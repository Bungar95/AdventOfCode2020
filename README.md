# Kotlin repository (terminal projects)
I've merged (currently) 2 of my previous projects: a '30day challenge' which I've done in kotlin, and Advent of Code 2020.

# AdventOfCode2020

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

Mine is in Kotlin.

People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

# Jetbrains challenge

Projects made during a 30 day challenge by JetBrains.

During the challenge I decided to start learning Kotlin.

This are the projects I've done during the challenge.
